                <p className='mission-text'>Who wouldn't want to do something for themselves. What person wouldn't want to make extra money and not have to answer to anyone higher up on the chain of command. Not us. I'm sure we all have a skill set or idea that sets us apart from everyone else.. but maybe we don't act upon it.. or do it for our day to day careers. Or maybe we do and we have opportunities to extend our skills beyond our day jobs. Either way, we still all have a common problem. A problem that if solved, could allow us to quit that stressful, soul dimming and difficult career. That problem is nothing more than clients, customers and lack thereof. I've been there, I know better than anyone exactly what you are going through. I was and still am an oil painter. An oil painter who did nothing but paint and everything but sell my paintings. As an artist who was touch-up painting hotel rooms for a living, I would long for a career change. I would day dream about how if I could sell only two paintings a month, I would be making the same amount of money as on the side as I would for my "real job". Clearly I needed help. So I came up with an idea that could not only help me but help thousands of other people who were in my exact same situtation. Artists, photographers, plumbers, tattooers, contractors, anyone who has a skill set but can not find the clients to allow them the freedom to do it themselves, full time or even just on the side. List your skill and wait for your clients who need you to find you. It's a small but vital part. Become a real member of </p>
